# z04: Regularity and events — mathematical author and independent review prompt

Use the adjacent `descriptor.json` as the frozen implementation contract. Verify its source hashes before changing this axis. The actual registry descriptor, engine result version and projection versions are distinct fields; do not silently equate them.

## Astra mathematical author

An authenticated **gpt-6-astra** author must state the precise claim and implement only the authorized scope. **gpt-6.1-sol may perform engineering only** (packaging, UI, wiring, documentation mechanics); it must not substitute for mathematical authorship or approval. Naming a model in text is not evidence of its actual use.

For this axis the current computation is:

The numerical branch returns None; optional spec.smoothness is a declaration, not a derivative/event proof.

Operational scope: **declaration scope only**. Units/convention: structured regularity label. Work with y=D^-1 x, tau=t/Ts, g=Ts D^-1 f(t,Dy), J=Ts D^-1 A D unless the formula explicitly returns physical coordinates. Use L2, with Frobenius only where specified.

The critical mathematical boundary is: **Classical differentiability, switch surfaces and Lipschitz constants are not discovered.**

Explain why each dependency in descriptor.json is necessary. Preserve separate declared, numerical, analytic and independently certified evidence. No bound-certificate adapter is implemented for this axis. Do not invent a certificate route. Preserve null/failure semantics; a zero value must represent an actual measured/derived zero. Inspect full_original_window and reference provenance; partial observations must not silently acquire full-horizon scope.

Required axis-specific example specifications:

- **positive — proposed, not executed as written:** Supply smoothness=analytic for f=-x. Expected: Declared analytic label; proposition remains unknown.
- **counterexample — proposed, not executed as written:** f=abs(x) with a supplied smoothness label. Expected: Any declaration remains unverified; a false analytic claim must not be promoted.
- **degenerate — proposed, not executed as written:** Omit smoothness. Expected: unsupported/missing declaration, not analytic by default.

These examples are proposed, not run by this document. Produce actual isolated-run artifacts with the input, expected assertion, observed value/status, tolerances, code hash and complete output. Related existing test references are in descriptor.json and must not be relabeled as execution of a different example.

For a new or changed evaluator, prepare an `evaluator_proposal_v1` submission conforming to `../../evaluator-proposal-contract.json`: mathematical definition, supported scopes/evidence, units, versioned projections, dependencies/execution contract, primary sources or explicit derivation artifacts, and these positive/counterexample/degenerate cases. State what is unproved. Never execute submitted untrusted source on the host; use the reviewed isolated runner.

## Independent Astra reviewer

A **different authenticated gpt-6-astra reviewer** must inspect the actual implementation and source hashes, independently derive the formulas and all expected examples, check scaling and scope, verify null cases and each projection's version/evidence acceptance, and inspect real test artifacts. For z04, explicitly challenge this failure mode: f=abs(x) with a supplied smoothness label. The required distinction is: Any declaration remains unverified; a false analytic claim must not be promoted.

Also inspect the degenerate boundary: Omit smoothness. Expected handling: unsupported/missing declaration, not analytic by default. Do not accept a sampled or declared property as a theorem. Record accepted/rejected/unresolved findings and limitations, exact proposal and implementation SHA256, reviewer identity, model provenance and review artifact hash. A copied approval flag or self-declared model name is insufficient. The author cannot approve their own mathematics.

Return missing evidence when any obligation is absent. `ready_for_governed_execution` is workflow readiness only; this prompt and its examples do not certify mathematical truth or authorize automatic deployment. Do not replace numerical measurement fields with certified domain bounds; preserve the separately bound claim route where implemented.
